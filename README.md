# Markdown Toy

It's a course project which is developed in  December 2021, when I started to learn Qt desktop development and learn how to use Git.

So the git history can be very weird and the organization of the Git repository is not elegant.

This is a Qt application to preview Markdown text. The application has functions below:

- real-time preview
    - It can render the preview as soon as  you edited the text
- edit and save
    - you can edit the markdown text and save to file
- search the files in the directory
    - It can search the files in a target directory recursively, you can use regex to describe the file name

Except the Markdown preview, the application can also preview the .docx and .tex files, but this function is really very crude and imperfect. In fact, it can only show the plain text in .docx files and support very limited keywords of Latex.

All in all, it just a toy : )
